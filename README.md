# Exam-access-control_python-code
A simple Python script that verifies user access to an exam portal using a 3-attempt PIN authentication system. Locks access after failed attempts.

This Python script simulates a PIN authentication system for an exam portal. The user is given three chances to input the correct PIN ( ). If the correct PIN is entered within these attempts, the system displays “Access Granted to Exam Portal” and exits. If the user enters the wrong PIN, it notifies them of the remaining attempts. After three failed attempts, the system displays “Exam Access Locked”, preventing further access.

The code uses a for loop to count down the attempts and simple if-else conditions to handle success and failure cases.

## Over view
This Python script implements a simple 3-attempt PIN verification system that grants access if the correct PIN is entered and locks access after three failed attempts.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to demonstrate how simple security measures like PIN verification can be implemented in Python to protect access to sensitive systems, such as an exam portal, and to introduce beginners to basic authentication logic.

I created this project to understand and implement the fundamentals of user authentication and input validation using Python. It solves the basic problem of unauthorized access by allowing only users with the correct PIN to enter a secure area — in this case, an exam portal.

I Learned
* How to use loops and conditions to control user access

* How to manage limited login attempts securely

* The importance of user feedback and error handling in access systems

* Basics of secure design and how to simulate real-world login logic

  ## Features
  * Userame and Password
  * 3 Login Attempts
  * Lockout Message after failed attempts
  * Easy to customize for more users
