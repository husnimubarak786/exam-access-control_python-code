# exam-access-control_python-code
A simple Python script that verifies user access to an exam portal using a 3-attempt PIN authentication system. Locks access after failed attempts.

This Python script is a basic PIN-based access control system for an exam portal. It allows the user up to three attempts to enter the correct PIN (xxxx). If the correct PIN is entered, access is granted. If the user fails all three attempts, the script locks access and denies entry to the exam portal.
